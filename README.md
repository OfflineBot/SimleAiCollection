# AI Collection
A storage for different kinds of AI, made as simple as possible to understand how they work.

## Requirements:
+ python
+ numpy

## Implements: 
+ Basic Neural Network (nn.py)
+ Deep Learning Neural Network (dl.py)
+ Convolutional Process (convolution.py) 
+ Recurrent Neural Network (rnn.py)
+ Reinforcement Learning (rl.py)

## What they do:
### Neural Network:
Recognize pattern between input and output data. 
### Deep Learning Neural Networks:
Like Neural Networks but with multiple hidden Layers to learn more complex data.
### Convolutional Process:
Prepocessing the input Image to learn the important Details of the Image. Speeds up the learning process of the Neural Network later.
### Recurrent Neural Network:
Learn a sequence of data and can predict new and unseen patterns. Can be used with NLP (Natural Language Processing) to create Chatbots.
### Reinforcement Learning:
(Agent) Explores given environment and based on positive or negative rewards doing the same or new action to get faster to given goal.
